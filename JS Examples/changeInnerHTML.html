<h1 id="aaa">My First JavaScript</h1>

<p>JavaScript can change the content of an HTML <i>element</i>.  It
  can be done by assigning an element an <tt>id</tt> and use
  that <tt>id</tt> to change the <i>inner content</i> of the element
  as we can see two examples here: one changing the element by
  a <tt>p</tt> tag and the other by an <tt>h1</tt> tag.</p>

<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Click Me!</button>

<p id="demo">This is a demonstration that will be modified by
  JavaScript when the user clicks on the <tt>Click Me!</tt>
  button.</p>

<p>Note that we used an <tt>id</tt> to identify an element for
  programming in JavaScript as well as controlling the style in CSS as
  we did last time.</p>

<p>In the HTML DOM object model, the <tt>document</tt> object
  represents your web page. Within that object, we can identify
  elements.</p>

<p>You can set any value that is valid in HTML as the value
  of <tt>innerHTML</tt> enclosed in double quotes.  If you must have a
  quoted string inside another string, use a single quote pair inside
  a double quote pair as it is done in Line 1 above.  Or,
  alternatively, a double quote pair inside a single quote pair.</p>

<p>Interesting question: When you click on the button, does the web
  browser reload the entire page or does it only update those parts of
  the page that are being affected by the JavaScript function?  How
  would you find out? Think about it.  I will tell you my answer
  in <tt>js3.jtml</tt> later.</p>
