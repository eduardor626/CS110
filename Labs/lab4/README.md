## Ethics Questions

### Question 1

> Give two possible chatroom moderation features and the reasons that you should implement each one

1) A future moderation to implement in the chatroom is to be able to delete it once the users don't use it anymore. It is possible to delete the chatroom in the MongoDb Database but it would be easier if they can delete it on the home page.

2) Notification/Sound bar. We should implement these features because it would be useful for a person who is doing there studies on the computer and they can see from windows notification of the chat message. Also when the person does get notified they should be able to hear a sound with it as well.
