## Project Description
<!-- you can include known bugs, design decisions, external references used... -->

I have a ghost feature which allows the user to see all the messages from a specific chat with just the chat in the url. roomName/userName --> user can type message
roomName/ ---> user can only see messages in that chat

## Steps to run the code
1. First run npm install npm
2. Then run npm install nodemon
3. To start, npm run start

## Ethics Questions

### Question 1

> Give two possible chatroom moderation features and the reasons that you should implement each one

```
1) A future moderation to implement in the chatroom is to be able to delete it once the users don't use it anymore. It is possible to delete the chatroom in the MongoDb Database but it would be easier if they can delete it on the home page.

2) 


```

## Known Bugs
Every time a person sends a user a message in the chatroom, it used to say waiting for localhost infinitely. It would still send the message but it would just be reloading the page infinitely.
